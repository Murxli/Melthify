<h1>Welcome to the SSN ACM 10th Year Anniversary Hackathon!</h1>
<p>We are excited to invite all students to participate in this event and showcase their skills and creativity.</p>

<ul>
  <li>GPTzero project: Develop an application that analyzes texts to determine whether they were generated by an AI.</li>
  <li>Traffic Management System: Design a real-time traffic management system that integrates with GPS and other traffic data sources to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion in urban areas.</li>
  <li>Sustainable Energy Management: Create a platform that utilizes data analytics and machine learning to optimize energy consumption in buildings and other facilities, reducing energy waste and promoting sustainability.</li>
  <li>Mental Health Support System: Develop a platform that uses AI and chatbots to provide mental health support and counseling to people suffering from stress, anxiety, or other mental health issues.</li>
